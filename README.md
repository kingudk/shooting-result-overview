# shooting-result-overview

Simple program to display and print result PDF files produced by a SIUS Acsor electronic target system. 

The program is intented to be used by the DSB/ASF sport club in the indoor facilities. As such it is fairly simple, and not much have been done to ensure that it is generally practical. 

Stuff that is planned to be adressed:
- Tweaking of layout
- Error handling
- General code clean up
- Addition of a proper log framework (rather than just spamming stdout).
- Addition of unit tests
